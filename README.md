A toolbox for Undertow/Rx/Guice.


## Release process
The shell script `release.sh` can be used to prepare a release. It performs
the following steps:

  * create a new branch for the release commits
  * create a commit and a tag for the new release version
  * verify that tag by invoking `./mvnw clean verify`
  * increment to the next development version and commit it
  * push the new branch to the remote repository
  * TODO: automatically open a Pull Request

After the pull request has been merged, the tag can be pushed:

    git push origin <TAG_NAME>
    
## Specific instructions
###  Usage of the LogbookHandler
The LogbookHandler expects an obfuscation function of type `Function<String, String>` 
to be injected. This function prevents confidential path parameters in the URI to be 
logged as plain text.
